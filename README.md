# Info
  - This repository is official implementation of 
 [Zero-Shot Knowledge Distillation Using Label-Free Adversarial Perturbation With Taylor Approximation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9380328)
  - The most of code is based on [ZSKT](https://github.com/polo5/ZeroShotKnowledgeTransfer)
# Recommendation
 - I recommend to use pretrained weight from [ZSKT](https://github.com/polo5/ZeroShotKnowledgeTransfer)
 - When if you use a model customly trained by yourself through CIFAR-10_train.py in this repository, you probably get a lower results than ZSKT and ours.
